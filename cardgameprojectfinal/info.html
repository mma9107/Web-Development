			<h3> History </h3>
			Card-playing is said to have originated in China and spread across the world. The earliest surviving decks of cards were hand-painted and affordable only by the wealthy. By 1418, decks were being mass-produced in Ulm, Nuremberg, and Augsburg using woodcuts. Throughout time, card games develop suits using every-day items such as leaves. By 1942, Bicycle Spotter Decks were made for soldiers to identify different attack vehicles from other countries. In 1966 during the Vietnam War, two lieutenants requested Ace of Spades cards (such as the ones in old army helmets). This frightened the Viet Cong because they believed it predicted death for enemies. Soon after, cards became seen as a recreational game in America for all people to play.

			<h3> How To Play </h3>
			The deck of cards is first fully distributed to each player's hand. Each player will take turns putting cards down. *Players may not look at the cards* Whoever's card is higher, that player takes both cards and places it into their deck. If both players have the same card (number), then the players go through the War process: each player places down three cards face-down and flip over the fourth card. Whoever's card is higher, that person takes all the cards and places it into the bottom of their deck. You may repeat the process as many times as necessary. The game ends when one player has no more cards. The player with the higher amount of cards wins the game.
